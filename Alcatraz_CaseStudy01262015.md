#Case Study #1 - AlcatrazTickets.com 
**AlcatrazTickets.com** came to Whitelabel in early 2014 to improve the performance of their AdWords & Bing Ads campaigns. Utilizing best practices and unexplored angles, our Growth team was able to uncover the following year-over-year improvements:

---

	**178% increase in relevant traffic**
 ---
 
 	**224% increase in conversions**
 	
 ---
 	
 	**168% increase in est. profit*


##How we did it


	Improved ad copy / CTA’s by testing new ads against a ‘control’

The ads above are very similar but there are subtle differences. The 1st ad is our control. The 2nd is nearly a carbon copy with the exception of the second description line.

This simple test lead to a 2% increase in conversion rate while driving a 25% _decrease_ in cost / conversion. Pretty cool, huh?


	Improved Quality Score on highest volume keywords

Notice below - on December 1st, 2014 the AlcatrazTickets.com AdWords account was spending $2.15/click on average.

Our team saw this as a major opportunity to reduce the avg. CPC, thus increasing daily traffic. We knew we had one main metric to improve: **Quality Score**

**Quality Score** is a grading system used by AdWords & Bing Ads to rank the relevance and expected click-through rate of a keyword as it relates to the ad it will trigger. This analysis is scored on a 1-10 scale. The higher your Quality Score for a given keyword, the better the placement and the lower the CPC. This, in theory, means you pay less for results when your quality score is strong. So how do you improve quality score? 

1. Better keyword/ad group relationship
1. Better relationship between keywords and ads
1. Better relationship between keywords and landing page

Improving Quality Score on an account like Alcatraz was fairly systematic to tackle. Too many keywords in a single ad group? Make them more relevant by making smaller groups. Current Destination URL not performing as well as you’d like? Adjust the content on-page to target particular keywords or send them to a more relevant page. 

So what happened in the 60 days we spent focused solely on Quality Score?

￼

The Growth team at Whitelabel was able to reduce the CPC by nearly 50% while virtually maintaining the number of sales accrued via AdWords in a given day. Long story short: we’ve helped our client free up budget for other important channels by formulating better overall campaigns.



	Double down on what’s working, shut off what's not

Review the ads from the first example. If we compare the two, our strategy would be to use ad #2 as the control, pause #1 (NEVER delete ads that have data attached to them…deleting the ad deletes the data. The same goes for campaigns, ad groups, and keywords. ), and test 2-3 more ads within that ad group.
